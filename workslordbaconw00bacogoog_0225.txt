TO THE EARL OF BUCKINGHAM.

Ma vuar 0000 1000,

11001 lordship may marvel, that together with
the letter from the board, which you see passed so
well, there came 00 0111100111 letter 1100 myeelf3
wherein, though it be true, that now this very even·
ing 1 heve made even with the causes 01 chancery,
and comparing with the causes heard by my 101111
that dead ia, 01 Μ1011001011 1010 was twelvemonth,
Ifind them to be double ao many and 000 0010;
besides that the causes that I despatch do seldom
turn upon me again, ss his many times did, yet
nevertheless l do assare your lordship, that should
have been no excuse to me, who shall ever assign
both 10 the causes 01 1110 subject, 001, 101 10 my
health, but the leavings 01 11001 after his Majesty’s
business done. But the truth is, I could not speslt
with Sir Lionel Craufield, with whom 01 necessity
l was 10 000101 about the names, till this aftemoon.

Fiat, therefore, 1 1001 the names, by his advice,
and with mine own good allowance 01 those, which
we wish his Majesty should select; wherein 1 have
had respect somewhet to 1010, 0010 10 1110 avoiding
01 opposition, but most to the service.

Two most important effecte his Majeaty’s letter
110111 wrought already: the 000, that 00 perceive
his Majesty will go through atitch3 which goeth to
the root 01 our diocese. The other, that it swaketh
the particular officere, and 01110110 their own cn-
deavours and propositions less perfunctory, and more
solid and true 101 1110 future. Somewhat is 10 be
done presently, and somewhet by reasonable degrees.
For the present, my advice is, his Majesty would
be pleased 10 01110 bach to the table, that hc doth
well approvc, that we did not 001 bach or retard
the good ways we were in 01 0011011011 101 that we
understood his Majeety's right: that hia late direc-
1100 was to give help, aad 001 hinderenoe, to the
former contusa, and that he doth expect the propo-
sitione we have in hand, when they are finished:
and 11111101 1110 subcommiasions, he hath seut us
the names he hath chosen out 01 those by ua sent
001 0100000101; 101 that he leaveth the particular
directions 1100 1100 10 1100, in the uae 01 subcom-
missioners, wholly to the table.
