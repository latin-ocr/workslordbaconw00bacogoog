Posrscawr, RELATING TO THIS SECOND EDITION.

Srrcr the former edition, there came into my hands, among the collectione iu print and manuscript, re·
hringo lord Bacon and his works, made by the late John Locker, Esq. two letters 01 Dr. Tenison, aiter·
rardr srehbishop 01 Canterbury, which will enable me to glyc the public 1011 satisfaction, 10 what manner
that learned divine 11000010 possessed 011110 Lattara, dyc. 011110 noble author publisbed by me.

One 01111000 letters, the original, written to Mr. Richard Chiswell, the boohseller, 101 whom the Bn-

enimc had been printed, is as follows:
Decemb. 16, 1682.

‘¹ Sra,

⁹5⁸. ldsxims ot' Low, dre. all printed already: but they contain some things 111 10 be printed; and they
01110 letters will make a handsome 10110, which 1 doubt not but will turn to account For the Letters,

‘⁴ ater the holy-days 1 will methodica all, and put all letters 01 the same date together, (for as yet they
010 10 confusion) aad then we will take 10111101 resolutione about them. I will get an aiternoon (it' God
permit) to ree the remaining papers in Bartholomew·Close. The Greek MS. will not prore much worth.
The latter and greater part is only a piece 01 Taetaes.
