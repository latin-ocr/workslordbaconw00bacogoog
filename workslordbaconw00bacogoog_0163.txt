'lar gratitnde, which lowe you for the honour end other important advantsges ol your friendship‚ bath
olen made me wish for an opportunity ol making you some return equal, in any degree, ιο your merit,
end ny own obligatione. lt was, therefore, a very agreeablc' incident to me, when by means of your
noble brother, the Lord Viecount Royston, always attentive to enlsrge the fund of history, aa well as to
tmomnge and reward every attempt in favour of literature in general, there was put into my hands a
mune of original papers of the great Lord Bacon. This volume was, at his lordship’s request, readily
nomed with me by his Grace the lord archbishop of Canterbury, whose real ior the advaneement of
neful learning ot all kinds beare a just proportion tothat which he has shown in every station of the
thvrrh filled by him, for the support of religion, and for what is the most perfect system of its principles,
ins and menone-Christianum
. Fron the long acquaintance with which I have been favonred by you, and the frequent conversations
rlieb ve have had upon subjecte foreign to the profession which yon so much adom, l well knew your
liuh mutium for the writings of Bacon, and your thorough knowledge of the most abstruse ol them.
fitting, therefore, with an application little less than thet of decyphering transcribed from the first
lrwghts and digested into order, a collection of his letters, little inferior in number, and much superior
w contenta, to what the world heth hitherto seen, intermixed with other papers of bis of an important
utare, 1 could not doubt, but that the publishing of them would be no less acceptable ιο you, than, 1
mdc myself they will be to the public. For it is scarce to be imagined, but that the bringing to light,
lm &oenrity and oblivion, the remains of so eminent a person, will be thought an acquisition not infe·
dotto the discovery (if the ruins of Herculaneum should etiord such a measure) of e new eet of the
‘Mu ol Cicero, whom our immortal countryman most remarkably resembled as en cratone philosopher,
tenui, a lsnyer, and a statesman. The communication of them to the public appearing to me a duty
toit and the memory of the authento whom could l, seperately from the consideration oi all personsl
tunnam and inducements, so justly present them, as ιο him, whom every circumstance ol propriety,
Μ omformity of character, in the most valuable part elit, pointed out tome for that purpose? Simila·
'ily of geninsr the same extent of knowledge in the lewa of our own and other countries, enriched and
dnum with all the stores oi ancient and modern learning; the same eloquence et the bar and in the
mter an equal force of writing, shown in a single work indeed, and compoaed at a very early age, but
&hire oia grand question of law and sanction of government, the monada of which had never before
beth stated with elne precision; and the most successful discharge oi the mmo offices of king's counsel
Μ solicitm and attorneygeneral.

’Μ rmsons, Sir, give your name an unquestionable right ιο be prefixed to these posthumous pieces.
And Ι hope, while l am performing this act oi justice, l may be excused the ambition of preserving my
mnemeby rmiting it with those ol Baoorv and Yonrn.
