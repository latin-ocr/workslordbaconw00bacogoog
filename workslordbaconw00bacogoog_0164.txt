PREFACE.

As the reader will undoubtedly heve some curiosity about the history of thetransmissiuuof these papers,
now presented to him at the distance 01 au hundred and forty years from tbe date of most of them, though
the hand ot' the incomparsble writer is too conspicuous in them ιο admit of any suspicion 01 their'genuine-
neas, it will be proper here ιο give him some information upon that subject. Dr Thomas Tenison is
known ιο have been the editor 01 the Buconiann, published at lundon, 1679, though he added only the
initial letters 01 his name to the account ⁰f cll tls lord Bccon'e works, ¹ subjoined to that collection He
had been an intimate friend 01, and fellow of the sante college† with Mr. William Rawley, only son of
Dr. william Rawley, chsplain ιο the lord chancellor Bacou, and employed by his lordship, as publisber of
most 01 his works. Dr. stley dying ιιι the 79th year 01 his age, J une the ldth, 1667, neara year aher his
son3 ι his executor, Mr. John stley, put into the hands 01 his friend Dr. Tenison these papers 01 lord
Bacou, which composed the Baccanae,- aud probably, ιι the same time, presented to him all the rest 01
his lordship’s manuscripts, which Dr. llawley had been possessed 01, 1)οι did not think proper to maloe
public. The reasons 01 1ιίι reserve appear from Dr. 'l'enison’s ιοοοιιιι ς cited above, ιο heve been, “ that he
judged some papers touching mettere osstme to tread too near to the heels 01 truth, and to the times of the
persons concerned: aud that he thought his lordship¹s lettere concerniug bis fall might be injurious to hia
honour, and cause the old wounds of it tobleed anew.” But this is a delicacy, which though suitable to the
age in which Dr. Rawley lived, and ιο the relation under which he had stood to his noble patron, ought
ιο base no force in other times aud circumstances, nor eser ιο be too much indulged to the prejudice 01 the
rights 01 historical truth.

Dr. Tenison being, soon after tbe publication 01 the Bccont'aac, removed from the more private station
01 a country living ιο the vicarage of St Martin's in the Fields, westminster, and, after the revolution,
advnnced to the bishopric of Lincoln, andatlast to the archbishopric of Canterbury‚hnd scaree leisure, if he
had been inclined, ιο select more 01 the papers 01 his admiredBacon. These therefore with the rest of his
manuscripts, not already deposited in the library at Lambeth, were left by him in hie last vill dated the
llth 01 April, 1715, ιο his chsplain, Dr. Edmund Gibsou, then rector 01 Lambeth, and afterwards sucees-
sively bishop 01 Lincoln and London, and ιο Μι. (atlerwards Dr.) Benjamiu lbbot, who bad succeeded Dr.
Gibson as library-keeper to his Graue. Dr. lbbot dying ll many years before bishop Gibson, the whole col·
lection of archbishop Tenison’s papers came under thc disposition 01 that bishop, who directed his two
executors, the late Dr. Bettesworth, desnos the Arches, and his eldest son, George Gibson, Esq. to deposita
them, with the addition 01 many others 01 bis own collecting, in the manuscript library at Lambeth: and
accordingly efter his lordship’s death, which happened on the 6th 01 Sept. 1748, all these manuscripts
tvere delivered by his said executore to archbishop Herring, on the 21st 01 October 01 that year, and placed
in the library οιι the aad 01 February following. But as they lay undigested in bundles, sud in that
'condition were neither convenient for use, nor secure from damage, bis Graue the present archbishop di·
rected them to bs methodiaed aud bound up in volumes with proper indexes, which was done by his
