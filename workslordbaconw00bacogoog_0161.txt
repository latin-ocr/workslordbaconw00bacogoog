Mn. Doctor Rawley, by his modest choice, hath

grucimsly inclined to temper mercy with justice, and their epistles; and l hace 0101 been of opinion,
md calling 10 10101 his former good services, and that those two piccesare the priucipal pieees 01001
how weil and profitably he hath spent his time antiquities: those orations discovering the form of
since bis trouble, sre pleased to remove from him administering justice, and the letters the carmage of
