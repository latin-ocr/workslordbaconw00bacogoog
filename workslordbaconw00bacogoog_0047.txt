your fortune were dead and buried, and as if there three points, which are directly significant, that her

scunrnrnodate your actions and mind to that end: l chamber, which apured ignominy; ahc limited the
ferr, Ι say, that this untimely despair may in time charge preciaely not to touch upon any pretence of
bring forth a just despair, by causing your lordship disloyalty; and no record remaineth to memory of
to slaehen and break oti‘ your wise, loyal, und aea- the charge or sentence. Fourthly, the very distino
made endeavoms and induatry for redintegration tion which was made in the sentence of sequestration
tn her liajesty¹sfavon13 in compariaon whereof all from the places of service in state, and leaving to
uther &mances are but as moni, or rather as a your lordship the place of master of the horse,doth,
mass without any substance at all. Against this to my understanding, indicativi, point at this; that
opinion it may please your lordship to consider of her Majeaty meantto use your lordship's attendance
these reasons which I have collected, and to malie in court, while the exercisea oi the other places stood
judgnent of them, neither out of the melancholy suspended. llifthly, lhave heard, and your lordship
oi your present fortune, nor out of the infusion ol hnoweth better than I, that now, since you were in
that which cometh to you by others¹ relation, which your own custody, her Majeaty in verbo regio, and by
hubert to much tincture, but ec rehu speie, out his mouth,to whom she committeth her royal granta
nithe nature ol the persons and actions themselves, and decreea, bath amured your lordship she will

nitu For though Iam so unfortunate as to bea heard her Majeaty to be a prince of that magnani-
stnngerto ber Maiesty'a eye, andmuch more to her mity‚ that she will spere the service of the ablest
mture and manners ς yet by that which is apparent, subJ‘ect or peer, when she shall be thought to stand
l do manifestly discam, that she hsth that character in need of it ; ao she is ol that policy, aa ahc will
of the divine nature and goodness, ‘⁴ quoa amavit, not lose the service of a mesner than your lordship,
auant usque ad tinem;” und where she bath a where it shall depeud merely upon her choice aud
creature, she dotb not defaee nor defeat it; inan wilh Seventhly, Ι hold it for u principle,that gene·

heretoiore she heth honoured with her special fa- cause is obscum and those sanent, whereot' the cause

aad ingratitudes in affecnon, but errors in atate hath been your error in your caumes towards her
maniae. Secondly, ii lcan spell and scholar· Majesty, which hath prejudiced you, that your

mehgi now towards your lordship, Ι cannot but maybesobersortunoe proprie. Laatly, considering
nahe this construction, that her Majesty in her your lordship is removed from dealing in causes of
toyal nimum never purposed to call your lord- atate, and left only to a place ol attendance; me-
ship's doiugs into public quostiam but only to have thinlra the ambition of any man, who can endure no
udsduud without a shower, in censuring them partners in state matters, may be so quenched, aa
husus temporary restraint only of liberty, and they should notlaboriously oppose themselves toyour
&bonag from her presence. For, first, the hand· being in court: ao aa upon the whole matter,1 cau ’
l'mg the cause in the starchsmber, you not be- findneitherinherMajesty’sperson,norin yourown
ἰῆς called, was enforced by the violence oi libelling person, nor in any third person, neither in iormer
md meurs, wherein the queen thought to have precedente, nor in your own case, any cause ol dry
aaut the world, and yet spared your lordship's und peremptory despair. Neither do Ι spealt this
appensum and after, when that meana which so, but that, it her Majeaty, out of her resolution,
ns irateuded for the quenching of malicioua bruita, should deaign you to a private life, you should be as
tuat to kindle thern because it was said your willing, upon her appointment, to go into the wilder-
bhhipmemdemneu unheard, andyourlordship‘s nessus into the land of promise. Onlylwiah your
liner trote that piquant letter, then her Majesty lordship will not preoccupate despair, but put trust,
ΕΙ plainly, that these winda of nimoura could not next to God, in her Majeaty’a grace, and not to be

misy making you a party, and admitting your juatly interpret, that tbiawhichl persuade, may have
deleme. And to this purpose 1 domeure your some reference to my particular, besam l may
