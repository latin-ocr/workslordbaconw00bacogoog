Loorruu for matter of service, I hare found out
a suit for myself ι ιιι ιι is proper for me more than
all men, because it is within the account of the ha·

will never beg any thing which shall not bring gain

lits of the alienatione, yielding a thousand pounds a
year more ιο ιιι king than bath been yielded com·
munibus annis, by a medium of sewen years. lf the
lring be pleased ιο grant methis, it will a little
warm the honour he hath given me, and 1 shall

huwe a new occasion to be, as l ever have been, and
shall be,
